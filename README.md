**A guide to building, training, and deploying machine learning models for developers and data scientists**

## What is this book about?
This updated second edition of Learn Amazon SageMaker will teach you how to move quickly from business questions to high performance models in production. Using machine learning and deep learning examples implemented with Python and Jupyter notebooks, youâ€™ll learn how to make the most of the many features and APIs of Amazon SageMaker.	

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Become well-versed with data annotation and preparation techniques
* Use AutoML features to build and train machine learning models with AutoPilot
* Create models using built-in algorithms and frameworks and your own code
* Train computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) models using real-world examples
* Cover training techniques for scaling, model optimization, model debugging, and cost optimization
* Automate deployment tasks in a variety of configurations using SDK and several automation tools

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
od = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(
container,
role,
train_instance_count=2,
train_instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge',
train_use_spot_instances=True,
train_max_run=3600, # 1 hours
train_max_wait=7200, # 2 hour
output_path=s3_output)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software engineers, machine learning developers, data scientists, and AWS users who are new to using Amazon SageMaker and want to build high-quality machine learning models without worrying about infrastructure. Knowledge of AWS basics is required to grasp the concepts covered in this book more effectively. A solid understanding of machine learning concepts and the Python programming language will also be beneficial.	

### Software and Hardware List

You will need a functional AWS account for running everything.
